# Geospatial Projects  
### by Sebin Sigy

## About me  
I’m Sebin Sigy from Kerala, India. I graduated with a BSc in Geography, with minors in Geology and Statistics. I’m working toward a career as a geospatial analyst. I enjoy working with maps, spatial data and practical problem solving.

## Why I built this repo  
I created this space to share my GIS projects and code. My goal is to help students and anyone interested in spatial analysis learn from real examples. You’ll find clear workflows, data notes and scripts that you can reuse or build on.

## What you’ll find here  
- GIS and remote sensing projects  
- Python notebooks for spatial analysis  
- Google Earth Engine scripts  
- ERA5 and climate data workflows  
- Maps, visuals and output summaries  
- Project write-ups and reproducible workflows

## Skills and tools  
- QGIS, ArcMap  
- Google Earth Engine  
- Python for spatial tasks  
- R for basic spatial and statistical analysis  
- Remote sensing and image processing  
- Basic statistics

## How to use this repo  
Each project folder has its own README explaining the purpose, data sources, steps used for processing, the code involved and the final outputs. Start with the project README to follow the workflow from start to finish.
